# Gilly7CE-Carpet-Addons
Some carpet rules which I think are pretty cool to have and would make the vanilla game better.
Use along side base fabric-carpet mod for the same minecraft version.
If you need help or want to discuss further addons please message me on discord: Gilly7CE#7462
# Rules
## sandFromSandstone
Blowing up sandstone with tnt will drop sand. Same is true for redsandstone to redsand.
## masonsSellSandstone
Stone mason villagers will now have a chance to sell sandstone. Works well with `sandFromSandstone` rule.
## regenChunks
Allows you to regenerate chunks in survial by holding a book, typing .s in chat and standing over a hopper. This will then kick you from the game and when you relog the chunk will have been regenated. This brings in behaviour from a bug exploit discovered by Andrew which worked in 1.17.0 and prior. USE WITH CAUTION.
