# Gilly7CE-Carpet-Addons
Some carpet rules which I think are pretty cool to have and would make the vanilla game better.
Use along side base fabric-carpet mod for the same minecraft version.
If you need help or want to discuss further addons please message me on discord: Gilly7CE#7462
# Rules
## accurateArrows (to be implemented)
Removes random momentum offsets from arrows.
## batsPersistentInLazyChunks (to be implemented)
Makes bats persistent when in lazy chunks. Allows for easier bat mob switches.
## creeperExplosionDropAllBlocks (to be implemented)
When a creeper explodes it drops all blocks destroyed, like TNT.
## chunkLoadersSave (to be implemented)
Chunk loaders activated before a server or world is stopped will automatically turn back on.
## disableLockingTrades (to be implemented)
Villager and Wandering Trader trades will no longer lock.
## disablePhantomSpawning (to be implemented)
Stops phantoms spawning.
## exactPortalGeneration (to be implemented)
When a portal is generated in the nether it will generate at the exact coordinates, regardless of terrain!
Cannot be used whilst rule `portalsGenerateOnRoof` is enabled.
USE WITH CAUTION.
## improvedRedstone (to be implemented)
Redstone does not give block updates and doesn't go through each power state to reach correct state.
## itemShadowSave (to be implemented)
Item shadowed items will save even when logged off or a server restarts.
## masonsSellSandstone (to be implemented)
Stone mason villagers will now have a chance to sell sandstone. Works well with `sandFromSandstone` rule.
## mobsDontPickUpItems (to be implemented)
Mobs which can pickup items will no longer do so. This prevents mobs becoming persistent accidentally. 
This won't affect Piglin bartering.
## portalsGenerateOnRoof (to be implemented)
When a portal is generated in the nether it will now always default to the exact location above the nether ceiling.
Cannot be used whilst rule `exactPortalGeneration` is enabled.
## regenChunks (to be implemented)
Allows you to regenerate chunks in survial by holding a book, typing .s in chat and standing over a hopper. This will then kick you from the game and when you relog the chunk will have been regenerated. 
This brings in behaviour from a bug exploit discovered by Andrew which worked in 1.17.0 and prior. USE WITH CAUTION.
## restoreRNGManipulation
Allows you to use RNG manipulation from the 1.12 and prior days!
## sandFromSandstone (to be implemented)
Blowing up sandstone with tnt will drop sand. Same is true for redsandstone to redsand.
